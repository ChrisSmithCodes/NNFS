 Neural Network From Scratch, based on Sentdex's design:

 Currently, I have a class created for the layers, but they require the user to know how to set them up properly in order to work. Soon, I will add a NeuralNetwork class that will contain a set of layers initialized by giving an array of integers, with each element representing the amount of nodes in that layer.
 
 The truthful next step is adding an activation function for the nodes (based on the next parts of the series), then training the nodes and adding a "save neural network" function to the whole project.
 
 Finally, I will test this basic design out with simple neural network patters, including the classic dog vs. cat test, and will hopefully take this information and go back to the square vs. circle design from Tsoding and Veritasium:
